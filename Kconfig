	  Enable the Layered Queue Driver framework for building
	  robust data pipelines in safety-critical embedded systems.

if LQ_DRIVER

config LQ_MAX_SIGNALS
	int "Maximum number of signals"
	default 32
	range 1 256
	help
	  Maximum number of signals that can be maintained by the engine.
	  Each signal represents a canonical value from a sensor or merged source.
	  Increase this if you have many sensors or merged values.

config LQ_MAX_CYCLIC_OUTPUTS
	int "Maximum number of cyclic outputs"
	default 16
	range 1 128
	help
	  Maximum number of cyclic (deadline-scheduled) outputs.
	  Each cyclic output periodically transmits a signal value.
	  Examples: J1939 messages, periodic CAN frames, etc.

config LQ_MAX_OUTPUT_EVENTS
	int "Output event buffer size"
	default 64
	range 8 256
	help
	  Size of the output event buffer used during engine step.
	  Should be large enough to hold all events generated in one cycle.
	  Typical: (num_cyclic_outputs + num_on_change_outputs) * 2

config LQ_MAX_MERGES
	int "Maximum number of merge/voter contexts"
	default 8
	range 1 64
	help
	  Maximum number of merge/voter contexts for redundancy management.
	  Each merge combines multiple redundant inputs using voting algorithms.

config LQ_HW_RINGBUFFER_SIZE
	int "Hardware input ringbuffer size"
	default 128
	range 16 512
	help
	  Size of the ringbuffer used to collect raw hardware samples
	  from ISRs and polling functions before processing.
	  Should be large enough to handle burst traffic between engine steps.

config LQ_LOG_LEVEL
	int "Logging level"
	default 3
	range 0 4
	help
	  0 = No logging
	  1 = Errors only
	  2 = Warnings and errors
	  3 = Info, warnings, and errors
	  4 = Debug (all messages)
