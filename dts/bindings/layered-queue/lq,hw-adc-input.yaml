  Hardware Input Source - ADC channel with ISR-safe ringbuffer
  
  Represents a single ADC channel that generates interrupts.
  An ISR handler will be auto-generated that:
  - Reads the ADC value
  - Calls lq_hw_push() to insert into ringbuffer
  - Wakes the engine task

compatible: "lq,hw-adc-input"

properties:
  signal-id:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Signal ID in the engine's signal array.
      This is where ingested samples will be stored.

  adc-channel:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: ADC channel number (hardware specific)

  adc-device:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Reference to the ADC device node.
      If omitted, uses the default ADC device.

  isr-priority:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: Interrupt priority for this ADC channel

  min-raw:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: Minimum raw ADC value (for validation)

  max-raw:
    type: int
    default: 4095
    description: Maximum raw ADC value (for validation)

  stale-us:
    type: int
    default: 100000
    description: |
      Staleness timeout in microseconds.
      If no new sample arrives within this time, signal is marked stale.

  init-priority:
    type: int
    default: 80
    description: |
      Device initialization priority.
      Must be > ADC device priority.
      Typical: 80 (after ADC at 60-70)
