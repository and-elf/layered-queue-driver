# Remap driver - maps input signals to named functions

description: |
  Remaps input signals to logical function names.
  
  This driver allows you to decouple hardware inputs from their logical
  purpose. For example, you might remap a joystick X-axis (hardware signal)
  to a "steering" function, or a trigger button to "throttle".
  
  The function-name is purely for documentation and DTS clarity - the actual
  signal routing uses signal IDs. However, this makes configurations much
  more readable and maintainable.
  
  Example use case:
    joystick_x (signal 0) -> remap -> "steering" function (signal 10)
    joystick_y (signal 1) -> remap -> "throttle" function (signal 11)
    button_a (signal 2) -> remap -> "fire" function (signal 12)

compatible: "lq,remap"

properties:
  input:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      (v2.0 - PREFERRED) Input source node phandle to remap.
      Example: input = <&joystick_x>;

  input-signal-id:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      (v1.x - DEPRECATED) Source signal ID to remap.
      Use 'input' phandle property instead for v2.0.

  output-signal-id:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      (v1.x - DEPRECATED) Output signal ID.
      In v2.0, output IDs are auto-assigned.
    description: Destination signal ID (the remapped function)

  function-name:
    type: string
    required: false
    description: |
      Human-readable name for this function (e.g., "steering", "throttle").
      This is for documentation purposes and doesn't affect code generation.

  invert:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      If true, invert the signal value (multiply by -1).
      Useful for reversing joystick axes.

  deadzone:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Deadzone threshold in raw units. Values within ±deadzone of zero
      will be clamped to zero. Useful for eliminating joystick drift.
      Default: 0 (no deadzone)
