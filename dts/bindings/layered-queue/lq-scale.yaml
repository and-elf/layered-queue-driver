# Scale driver - applies linear transformation to signals

description: |
  Applies a scale factor and offset to input signals.
  
  This driver performs the transformation:
    output = (input * scale / 1000) + offset
  
  The scale factor uses fixed-point with 1000 = 1.0, so:
    - scale = 1000 means 1.0x (no scaling)
    - scale = 2000 means 2.0x (double)
    - scale = 500 means 0.5x (half)
    - scale = -1000 means -1.0x (invert)
  
  Common use cases:
    - Convert ADC counts to engineering units
    - Normalize joystick range (-32768 to 32767) to percentage (-1000 to 1000)
    - Apply sensitivity adjustments to user controls
    - Convert between different units (RPM to Hz, etc.)
  
  Example: Joystick normalization
    Input: -32768 to 32767 (16-bit ADC)
    scale = 31  (approximately 1000/32)
    offset = 0
    Output: -1000 to 1000 (normalized percentage)

    description: |
      Value to add after scaling. In same units as output.
      Default: 0

  clamp-min:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Minimum output value (clamping). If specified, output will be
      clamped to this minimum. Useful for limiting control ranges.

  clamp-max:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Maximum output value (clamping). If specified, output will be
      clamped to this maximum. Useful for limiting control ranges.
