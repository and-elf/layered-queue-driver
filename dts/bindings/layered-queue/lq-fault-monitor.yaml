description: |
  Fault monitor that checks signal conditions and outputs fault flags.
  
  Monitors a single input signal for various fault conditions:
  - Staleness: Signal hasn't updated within timeout
  - Range: Signal value outside min/max bounds  
  - Status: Signal has FAULT or INCONSISTENT status
  
  When any enabled fault condition is detected, sets the fault output
  signal to the configured fault-level, otherwise 0 (OK).
  
  Optionally can trigger limp-home mode by modifying a scale driver's
  parameters when faults are detected. This provides automatic safety
  degradation without requiring external wake callbacks.

    type: phandle
    description: |
      (v2.0 - PREFERRED) Node phandle to monitor for faults.
      Example: input = <&temp_scaled>;

    required: false
    description: |
      (v1.x - DEPRECATED) Signal ID to monitor.
      Use 'input' phandle property instead for v2.0.

    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      (v1.x - DEPRECATED) Signal ID for fault output (0=OK, 1=FAULT).
      In v2.0, output IDs are auto-assigned.

  fault-level:
    type: int
    description: |
      Severity level when fault is detected (default: 1)
      0 = No fault (informational)
      1 = Warning / Soft fault
      2 = Error / Medium fault
      3 = Critical / Hard fault
      Higher levels available with LQ_MAX_FAULT_LEVELS config

  wake-function:
    type: string
    description: |
      Name of wake callback function for IMMEDIATE safety response.
      
      Called during event ingestion when range faults are detected on
      RAW hardware values (before any processing, merging, or scaling).
      This provides the fastest possible response for safety-critical
      conditions.
      
      User must implement:
        void function_name(uint8_t monitor_id, 
                          int32_t raw_value,
                          enum lq_fault_level level)
      
      Use for immediate hardware safety actions:
      - Emergency shutdown
      - Power cutoff
      - Hardware brake engagement
      - Safety state transitions
      
      KEEP WAKE FUNCTIONS SHORT AND FAST - just set flags or trigger
      hardware. Complex processing belongs elsewhere.
      
      Note: Only range checks trigger immediate wake. Staleness and
      status checks happen later during full fault processing.

  limp-target-scale-id:
    type: int
    description: |
      Index of scale driver to modify when fault is detected (0-based).
      When specified, enables limp-home mode response. The fault monitor
      will automatically modify this scale driver's parameters when the
      fault is active and restore them when the fault clears.

  limp-scale-factor:
    type: int
    description: |
      Scale factor to use in limp mode (1000 = 1.0x).
      If not specified, normal scale factor is unchanged.
      Use to reduce sensitivity: 500 = half response, 250 = quarter response.

  limp-clamp-max:
    type: int
    description: |
      Maximum output clamp in limp mode.
      If not specified, normal clamp-max is unchanged.
      Use to limit maximum output when faults occur.

  limp-clamp-min:
    type: int
    description: |
      Minimum output clamp in limp mode.
      If not specified, normal clamp-min is unchanged.

  restore-delay-ms:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in milliseconds before restoring normal mode after fault
      clears. Prevents oscillation between modes (hysteresis).
      Default: 0 (immediate restore)
