	  Enable Layered Queue driver library for signal-based event processing.

	  This library provides a layered queue architecture for embedded systems
	  with signal processing, hardware input abstraction, and output dispatching.

	  The driver provides:
	  - Platform-independent core drivers
	  - Zephyr platform implementation
	  - Hardware abstraction for CAN, GPIO, PWM, I2C, UART
